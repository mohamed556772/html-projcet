			<blockquote><p>- Corona virus:
It is among the group of corona viruses that cause diseases such as colds and acute respiratory infection such as SARS virus, in China in 2019 and spread as a pandemic around the world a new type called severe acute respiratory syndrome corona begins with the title (Covid 19), as announced by the World Health Organization.
Symptoms:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has made some recommendations to prevent the disease and its most important symptoms are: fever, cough, shortness of breath, and among its symptoms are: fatigue, runny nose, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and finally loss of smell and taste.

Some signs appear two to 14 days after infection with the corona, and may appear very light or severe, and it may also not appear signs of the person at all, and we find that the elderly and people with diabetes, heart disease and respiratory system are more likely to be infected with the virus.
If you have urgent signs and symptoms associated with coronavirus, seek care immediately, especially if you come into contact with someone who has been diagnosed with it.
Corona virus spreads by contact with an infected person, or by touching the surface of the virus and touching its mouth, nose, or eyes. It is spread through the respiratory droplets released from the infected person when he sneezes or coughs, and care must be taken very carefully because it spreads very quickly between humans.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that you exercise caution and not go out except for the extreme necessity and adhere to the household isolation and ban established by most countries, and if you leave the house, wear a muzzle and use alcohol as a hand sanitizer, and when you return home immediately wash your hands thoroughly with soap for 20 seconds At least, avoid contact with the eyes, face and nose, and the mouth and nose should be covered when coughing or sneezing, and be careful in public places and areas of congestion, and if you are sick with the virus, go home and see a doctor. 
Using a mask in public may help reduce the spread of infection by people who do not have symptoms.  The general public is advised to wear non-medical cloth masks.  Surgical masks can be used if available.  However, surgical masks and N-95 masks should only be used by health care providers in some areas facing a shortage of such masks.

 After you get fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that you do not need to wear a mask except in cases required by instructions and laws.  You are fully vaccinated two weeks after you have had a second dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine or two weeks after you have had one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
