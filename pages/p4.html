			<blockquote><p>-Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing.  Dispose of the tissue after using it.  And wash your hands immediately.

 Avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth.

 Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.

 If you have a chronic condition and you're one of the groups most likely to develop severe symptoms in the event of an infection, talk to your doctor about additional ways to protect yourself.

 Should I wear a protective mask?

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that people who have not been fully vaccinated wear masks in public when social distancing is difficult.  However, those who have not been fully vaccinated should continue to wear a mask in enclosed public places and even outdoors when the risk of transmission of Covid-19 infection increases, such as during crowded events and large gatherings.  This recommendation is based on evidence that people with COVID-19 can transmit the virus before they realize they have it.

 Using a mask in public may help reduce the spread of infection by people who do not have symptoms.  The general public is advised to wear non-medical cloth masks.  Surgical masks can be used if available.  However, surgical masks and N-95 masks should only be used by health care providers in some areas facing a shortage of such masks.

 After you get fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that you do not need to wear a mask except in cases required by instructions and laws.  You are fully vaccinated two weeks after you have had a second dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine or two weeks after you have had one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.

 In the United States, everyone is required to wear a mask while on planes, buses, trains, and other public transportation.

 can i travel

 If you plan to travel, first check official travel warnings, and follow appropriate procedures when in public places.  It is also best to consult your doctor if you have health conditions that make you more susceptible to respiratory infections and complications.

 What can I do if I have been infected or suspect I have COVID-19?

 If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus, contact your doctor for advice.  If you need to go to the doctor or to the hospital, call ahead so that health care providers can take steps to make sure others do not become infected.

 Take the following precautions to avoid spreading the COVID-19 virus:

 Stay home and don't go to work, school, university or public areas, except to get medical care.

 If you can, avoid public transportation and taxis, including those ordered via smart apps.

 Wear a cloth mask while you are around others.

 Isolate yourself as much as possible from others in your home.

 Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible.

 Avoid sharing dishes, drinking glasses, bedding, and other household items.
