 Answer From British K Touch, M.D.

 A new virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of a disease that began in China in 2019. The resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

 In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it had classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.  Pandemic public health groups monitor and post updates online, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  These groups have also issued recommendations on preventing the spread of the virus.

 How does the Corona virus spread?

 The data showed that the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads from person to person through close contact (within 6 feet, or 2 metres).  The virus is spread through respiratory droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks.  This spray can be inhaled or put into the mouth, nose, or eyes of a nearby person.

 The COVID-19 virus can sometimes spread when a person is exposed to small droplets that remain in the air for several minutes or hours, and this is called airborne transmission.  It is not yet known how common the virus is to spread in this way.
